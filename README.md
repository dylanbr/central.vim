# Central.vim ðŸŒ· 

Create directories to store unique swap, backup, and undo files in a
centralized place.

Swap, backup, and undo are created in `~/.vim` 

```sh
.vim
â”œâ”€â”€ backup
â”œâ”€â”€ swap
â””â”€â”€ undo
```

Vim is then set to use these locations.
```vim
set undodir=~/.vim/undo//
set directory=~/.vim/swap//
set backupdir=~/.vim/backup//
```
