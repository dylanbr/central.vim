**Centralize Backup, Swap, Undo

Create directories to store unique backup, swap, and undo files in a
centralized place.

Backup, swap, and undo are created in `~/.vim` 

```sh
.vim
â”œâ”€â”€ backup
â”œâ”€â”€ swap
â””â”€â”€ undo
```

Vim is then set to use these locations.
```vim
set backupdir=~/.vim/backup//
set directory=~/.vim/swap//
set undodir=~/.vim/undo//
```
