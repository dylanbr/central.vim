# Central.vim ðŸŒ· 

**Centralize Backup, Swap, Undo**

Create directories to store unique backup, swap, and undo files in a
centralized place.

Backup, swap, and undo are created in `$VIMHOME` (which defaults to
`~/.vim` on Unix based systems).

```sh
$VIMHOME
â”œâ”€â”€ backup
â”œâ”€â”€ swap
â””â”€â”€ undo
```

Vim is then set to use these locations.
```vim
set backupdir=$VIMHOME/backup//
set directory=$VIMHOME/swap//
set undodir=$VIMHOME/undo//
```
