INTRODUCTION                      *central*

This plugin creates directories to store swap, backup, and undo files in a
centralized place. If they don't already exist, Central creates three new
directores inside `~/.vim` Swap, Backup, and Undo. 

Next, in order for Vim to take advantage of these new directories Central configures 
their location.
>
	set undodir=~/.vim/undo//
	set directory=~/.vim/swap//
	set backupdir=~/.vim/backup//
<

Notes                     *notes*

The trailing double slash `//` enables functionality that ensures each file added 
to the directories will be unique, thereby preventing overwrites.
