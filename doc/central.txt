INTRODUCTION                      *central*

This plugin creates directories to store backup, swap and undo files in a
centralized place. If they don't already exist, Central.vim creates three new
directories inside `~/.vim` Backup, Swap, and Undo. 

>
.vim
├── backup
├── swap
└── undo

In order for Vim to take advantage of these new directories Central.vim 
configures their location.
>
	set backupdir=~/.vim/backup//
	set directory=~/.vim/swap//
	set undodir=~/.vim/undo//
<

Notes                             *notes*

The trailing double slash `//` enables functionality that ensures each 
file added to the directories will be unique, thereby preventing overwrites.
