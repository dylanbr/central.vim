INTRODUCTION                      *central*

This plugin creates directories to store swap, backup, and undo files in a
centralized place. First it checks if the directories exist, if not it creates
three new directors, swap, backup, and undo inside ~/.vim 

CONFIGURATION                     *central-configuration*

In order for Vim to take advantage of these new directories we need to set their
location in .vimrc
>
	set undodir=~/.vim/undo//
	set directory=~/.vim/swap//
	set backupdir=~/.vim/backup//
<
The trailing double slash `//` enables functionality that ensures each file added 
to the directories will be unique, thereby preventing overwrites.
