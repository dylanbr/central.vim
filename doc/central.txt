INTRODUCTION                      *central*

This plugin creates directories to store backup, swap and undo files in a
centralized place. If these directories do not already exist, Central.vim
will create them inside your local `$VIMHOME` directory. 

>
$VIMHOME
├── backup
├── swap
└── undo

In order for Vim to take advantage of these new directories Central.vim 
configures their location.
>
	set backupdir=$VIMHOME/backup//
	set directory=$VIMHOME/swap//
	set undodir=$VIMHOME/undo//
	set backup swapfile undofile
<
This plugin also manages these directories by deleting any files older than
`g:central_cleanup_enable` days (which defaults to 30 days). This can be set
to any duration in days, or set to zero to disable auto deletion.
>
	let g:central_cleanup_enable = 30 "days
<

This plugin also maintain multiple backups each time a file is written
to. These backup files are saved in `$$VIMHOME/backup` and follow the
naming convention `<buffer name>~<original path>~<time stamp>`, thus
ensuing a unique backup each time the buffer is saved. This can be
disabled by setting `g:central_multiple_backup_enable` to zero, where
Vim will only maintain a single backup each time a file is written to.
>
	let g:central_multiple_backup_enable = 0

Notes                             *notes*

The trailing double slash `//` enables functionality that ensures each 
file added to the directories will be unique, thereby preventing overwrites.
